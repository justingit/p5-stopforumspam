WWW-StopForumSpam (Perl extension)
==================================

StopForumSpam is a Anti Spam Database for free usage. Even though aimed towards
preventing registration of spambots on a forum, this extension can be used for
any type of website (e.g. blog) as well.

This fork uses LWP, instead of WWW::Curl to access the API. 

An API key is only needed for reporting a new case of spam registration.
